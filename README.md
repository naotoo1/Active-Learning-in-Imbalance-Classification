# Active-Learning-in-Imbalance-Classification
Learning active instances on the border in the case of imbalanced data classification task.

The implementation is based on the border learning: Active learning algorithm for imbalance classification in ```active.py``` module
An extension and tranfer of the technique to the area of highly interpretatble and robust prototype-based models LVQ's has been exemplified with matrix-lvq in the ```active1.py```
