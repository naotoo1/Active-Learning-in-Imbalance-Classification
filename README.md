# Active-Learning-in-Imbalance-Classification
Learning active instances on the border in the case of an imbalanced data classification task.

 ## What is it?
The implementation is based on the border learning: active learning algorithm for imbalance classification with early stopping by using small pools in  ```active.py``` module.

An extension and transfer of the technique to the area of highly interpretable and robust prototype-based models LVQ's has been exemplified with matrix-lvq in the ```active1.py``` script.
